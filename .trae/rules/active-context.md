# Modi-Prompt - Active Development Context

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. Core Prompt Management
- CRUD operations for prompt creation, editing, and deletion
- Category and tag-based organization system
- Full-text search across all prompts
- Import/export functionality for prompt collections

### 2. AI Provider Integration
- OpenAI API integration (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo)
- Anthropic Claude API integration
- Google Gemini API integration
- Secure API key management and encryption
- Rate limiting and error handling for provider APIs

### 3. Testing Interface
- Multi-provider testing playground
- Parameter adjustment (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
- Response comparison between different models
- Test result history and export

### 4. User Interface & Experience
- Black and purple themed design system
- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Intuitive navigation and user flows

## Recent Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for lightweight state management
- React Router for client-side routing
- React Hook Form for efficient form handling
- Axios with interceptors for API communication

### Backend Architecture
- Node.js with Express.js for API server
- JWT authentication for user sessions
- JSON file storage for simplicity (upgradeable to MongoDB)
- Middleware-based request processing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Design System
- Primary colors: Black (#000000) and Purple (#8B5CF6)
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Consistent component library
- Responsive design patterns
- Accessibility considerations (WCAG 2.1)

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features
1. Basic project structure and configuration
2. Authentication system with JWT
3. Core prompt CRUD operations
4. Basic UI components with black/purple theme
5. API key management system

### In Progress
1. AI provider integration implementation
2. Testing interface development
3. Search and filtering functionality
4. Responsive design optimization
5. Error handling and validation

### Next Priorities
1. Complete multi-provider testing interface
2. Implement advanced search and filtering
3. Add prompt versioning system
4. Enhance mobile responsiveness
5. Add comprehensive error handling

## Technical Decisions

### Simplification Choices
- **Single User Focus**: No complex team collaboration features
- **File-based Storage**: JSON files instead of complex database setup
- **Essential Features Only**: Focus on core prompt management
- **Direct API Integration**: No complex middleware or queue systems
- **Simple Authentication**: Basic JWT without complex role systems

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading for different app sections
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- **Debounced Search**: Optimized search input handling
- **Efficient Rendering**: Virtualization for large prompt lists
- **API Caching**: Smart caching for AI provider responses

### Security Measures
- **API Key Encryption**: Secure storage of provider API keys
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive client and server validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin resource sharing
- **Error Sanitization**: No sensitive data in error responses
